# Project 19: Canoe ðŸ›¶

## Project Overview

In this project, students will create a canoe-themed game, similar to the Racing Car project. The teacher will provide the necessary sprites (like the canoe and water), but students are expected to complete the project on their own. This will give students the opportunity to practice their creativity and problem-solving skills while applying what they've learned so far.

## Key Concepts to Focus On

- **Sprite Movement**: Guide students in animating the canoe using movement blocks.
- **Backdrop Setup**: Help students create a realistic water or river backdrop for the canoe to float on.
- **Collision Detection**: Teach students how to detect if the canoe hits any obstacles or moves off-screen.
- **Scoring & Timer**: Introduce a timer to measure how long it takes to reach a destination, or add a score to track performance.

## Detailed Plan

1. **Introduction (10-15 minutes)**
   - Explain the goal of the project: to create a game where a canoe moves across water while avoiding obstacles.
   - Introduce the basic interface of Scratch and show where to find the movement and control blocks.

2. **Step-by-Step Instructions**
   - Step 1: Set up the backdrop (e.g., water, river).
   - Step 2: Add the canoe sprite and other objects that the students will move or interact with.
   - Step 3: Use the `when key pressed` or `when flag clicked` blocks to control the canoeâ€™s movement.
   - Step 4: Implement collision detection so the canoe stops or changes direction when it hits an obstacle (like a rock or log).
   - Step 5: Add a scoring system or a timer to make the game more engaging.

3. **Teacherâ€™s Tips**
   - Encourage students to focus on movement first before adding obstacles or scoring.
   - Be sure to show them how to add interactivity to the game by responding to key presses or mouse clicks.
   - Emphasize creativity in how the water scene is animated and how obstacles are created.

4. **Troubleshooting Common Issues**
   - Issue: The canoe moves too fast or too slow.
     - Solution: Adjust the number of steps in the movement block or add `wait` blocks to control the speed.
   - Issue: The canoe moves off the screen.
     - Solution: Show how to use `if on edge, bounce` or restrict movement within the game boundaries.

5. **Extension Ideas**
   - Challenge students to add more obstacles (e.g., rocks, logs) and make the game harder as time progresses.
   - Add a "start screen" or "game over" screen that appears when the player finishes or loses the game.
   - Allow students to create levels or add power-ups that help the canoe move faster.

## Conclusion

By the end of this project, students will have created a fun and interactive canoe game, where they will apply their knowledge of sprite movement, collision detection, and scoring.

### **Note**: If students are unable to complete the project during class, this will be assigned as homework.
