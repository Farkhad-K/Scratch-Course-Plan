# Project 8: Calculator ðŸ§®

## Project Overview

In this project, students will create a basic calculator using Scratch. The project will introduce them to key programming concepts such as asking for input, performing calculations, and displaying results.

## Key Concepts to Focus On

- **Ask and Wait**: Teach students how to ask the user for input and wait for the response.
- **Operators**: Focus on using arithmetic operators (`+`, `-`) to perform calculations.
- **Conditionals**: Use `if` statements to check the userâ€™s input and choose the correct operation.
- **Say Block**: Display the result of the calculation using the `say` block.

## Detailed Plan

1. **Introduction (10-15 minutes)**  
   - Explain the goal of the project: to create a calculator that asks the user for two numbers and then performs a calculation based on their choice.
   - Introduce the basic interface of Scratch and where to find the blocks for input and output.

2. **Step-by-Step Instructions**  
   - Step 1: Set up the user interface with sprite and a backdrop.
   - Step 2: Use the `ask` block to prompt the user for two numbers.
   - Step 3: Use `if` statements and arithmetic operators to perform calculations based on the userâ€™s input.
   - Step 4: Use the `say` block to display the result to the user.

3. **Teacherâ€™s Tips**  
   - Make sure students understand how to use the `ask` and `wait` blocks together to gather input from the user.
   - Emphasize the importance of comparing the input (using `if` and comparison blocks) and performing the correct arithmetic operation.
   - Show them how to update the calculator's design by adding more operations, like modulus or exponents, if they have time.

4. **Troubleshooting Common Issues**  
   - Issue: The result is incorrect after the user inputs their numbers.
     - Solution: Ensure students use the correct arithmetic operator (e.g., `+` for addition, `-` for subtraction) and the `if` blocks are set up properly.
   - Issue: The calculator only works for one type of operation.
     - Solution: Explain how to use multiple `if` blocks to handle different types of calculations based on user input.

5. **Home work**  
   - Challenge students to make the calculator handle more operations, like devision and multiplication.
   - Add a feature that allows users to clear the screen and reset the calculator.

## Conclusion

By the end of this project, students will have created a fully functional calculator and learned how to use input blocks, arithmetic operations, and conditionals to perform calculations and show results to the user.
