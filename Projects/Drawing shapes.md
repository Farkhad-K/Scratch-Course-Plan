# Drawing Shapes Project ðŸŸ©, ðŸ”¼, ðŸ”´

## Project Overview

In the **Drawing Shapes** project, students will use the **Pen extension** in Scratch to draw various shapes like circles, squares, and triangles. They will create their own simple **custom code blocks** to draw these shapes, reinforcing concepts like **procedures**, **repetition**, and **coordination of blocks**. This project will serve as an introduction to creating and using custom blocks in Scratch while offering a fun opportunity to practice the **Pen extension**.

## Key Concepts to Focus On

- **Pen Extension**: Introduce the **Pen extension** to students, allowing them to draw on the screen using code blocks.
- **Custom Code Blocks**: Teach students how to create their own custom blocks for drawing specific shapes. This helps to reinforce **modular programming** and **reusable code**.
- **Repetition and Loops**: Use loops to repeat actions needed to draw shapes (e.g., turning the sprite to complete a square or a triangle).
- **Procedures**: Understand how to group code into custom blocks, making it easier to reuse and organize.

## Detailed Plan

### 1. Introduction (10-15 minutes)
- **Introduction to Pen Extension**: Explain how the **Pen extension** allows sprites to draw on the stage by using blocks like `pen down`, `pen up`, `clear`, and `set pen color`.
- **Custom Blocks**: Introduce the concept of **custom blocks** by explaining how students can create reusable code blocks for drawing shapes.
- **Shapes Overview**: Discuss basic shapes (e.g., square, triangle, circle) and how they can be drawn using loops and angles.

### 2. Step-by-Step Instructions

#### Step 1: Set up the Pen Extension
- **Add the Pen Extension**: Go to the **Extensions** tab and select **Pen**.
- **Pen Setup**: Use `clear`, `pen down`, and `set pen color to [color]` blocks to set up the drawing environment.

#### Step 2: Draw a Square
- **Custom Block for Square**: Students will create a custom block called `draw square` which will be used to draw a square. To draw a square:
  - Move the sprite a certain number of steps forward.
  - Turn 90 degrees to make the next side of the square.
  - Repeat this process 4 times to complete the square.
